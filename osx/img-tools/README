img-tools for OSX. Loosely based on the Windows version of same, but kept in a
separate repo until we decide how much of the code should be shared. Check out
in your xen tree under osx/img-tools.

The tools:
* img-create: import a flat file into a uXen block format, e.g.,
  img-create fs.raw fs.swap

* img-shallow: import files from the host file system into an
  existing uXen block backend (not fully functional yet).

* img-hfs: port of existing HFS+ offline editing tool, run
  without args for usage.

Known bugs/limitations:

 * Pipes and sockets are silently ignored.
